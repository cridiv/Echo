Echo(Refix)

Echo is an intelligent, TiDB-native observability agent designed to help developers search, understand, and act on logs, metrics, and system behavior — all through natural language.

Built with LangChain and deeply integrated with TiDB, Echo transforms your operational data into a conversational assistant that gets smarter over time.

⚡️ What Echo Does
🔍 Semantic Log & Metric Search
Instantly find relevant logs, stack traces, and performance metrics using natural language — even across millions of entries.

🧠 Temporal Intelligence
Echo understands trends, spikes, and changes across time. Ask:

“When did this error first occur?”

“Has this deploy affected login latency?”

“Show error trends for the past 48 hours.”

🕸️ Error Correlation Engine
Echo connects related errors, services, and traces using vector similarity and graph-based memory. It doesn’t just answer — it explains root causes.

📈 Lightweight Metrics & Visuals
Ask Echo for summaries and comparisons:

“Compare success rates for signup vs login last week.”

“Visualize retry counts for job-worker service.”

🧰 LangChain + LangSmith Tooling
Every Echo response is traceable. Replay how Echo made a decision, what steps it took, and why — for full transparency and debugging.

🧩 Tech Stack
TiDB – High-performance HTAP database for structured + semi-structured log storage

LangChain – Orchestrates reasoning, retrieval, and tool usage

LangGraph – For agentic workflows like error correlation and diagnosis

LangSmith – Tracks Echo’s internal decision paths

OpenAI – LLMs for natural answers and summaries

Time-series embedding – Echo learns when and why things go wrong

🧠 Why Echo + TiDB?
TiDB stores logs, metrics, and structured data at massive scale. Echo turns that into intelligence.
Unlike other observability tools, Echo is:

🔗 Connected – Knows relationships between logs, traces, errors, services

🧭 Exploratory – You ask; Echo finds, explains, correlates

🗓️ Temporal – Understands when problems emerge and evolve

💬 Conversational – Answers like a teammate, not a dashboard

🛠 Use Cases
Debug Faster – “What changed before this error started happening?”

Understand Deploy Impact – “Did yesterday’s deploy cause slower logins?”

Correlate Incidents – “Are these three crashes related?”

Summarize Outages – “Give me a postmortem summary of last night’s incident.”

Visualize Performance – “Chart error rate for checkout service this week.”

🧪 Roadmap
✅ Vector-based semantic search over logs + docs

✅ Temporal log ingestion and storage in TiDB

🔜 Live error correlation with LangGraph

🔜 Metrics charting using TiDB SQL + visualization layer

🔜 LangSmith-powered observability of Echo’s own actions

💬 Echo’s Edge
Echo doesn’t just search — it thinks, learns, and explains.
It’s your AI SRE, built to speak fluent TiDB.
